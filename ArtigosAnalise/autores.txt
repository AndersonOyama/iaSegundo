<START:tema>Feedback Controllers as Financial Advisors for Low-Income Individuals<END>
<START:person> Hugo Gonzalez Villasanti <END> and <START:person> Kevin M. Passino <END>, Fellow, IEEE
Abstract— Feedback controllers are introduced to help manage
an individual’s or household’s financial life and build savings. The
controllers can be viewed as financial advisors for an individual’s
resource allocation problem, which is modeled as a nonlinear
discrete time stochastic system with income uncertainties, asset
losses, and constraints on cash flow and credit. We introduce a
model predictive controller (MPC) and a proportional-integral-
derivative (PID) controller, and compare them with a benchmark
method employed in finance and economics, stochastic dynamic
programming (DP). Both MPC and PID produce similar consis-
tency in financial management compared with DP. They also
offer the advantage of low computational complexity relative
to DP, which allows us to efficiently perform assessments of
robustness (reliability) and disturbance rejection (e.g., effects of
uncertainties), both of which are of significant practical engineer-
ing importance. In addition, this flexibility enables us to uncover
the system’s properties, such as the existence of a “poverty
trap" caused by constraints in the control space and dynamics.
The effectiveness of a PID-based aid intervention for low-skilled
and low-endowed agents that lie within the trap is assessed
and contrasted with other existing cash transfer programs, with
results that support a further implementation analysis. These
assessments constitute a novel application of feedback controllers
that, besides effectively dealing with scarcity constraints, present
practical advantages that are shown to translate into an ability
to implement the MPC or PID controller in a variety of ways
for low-income individuals via computer-assistive methods (e.g.,
a cell phone).

Abstract—Much research has been conducted arguing that tip-
ping points at which complex systems experience phase transitions
are difficult to identify. To test the existence of tipping points in
financial markets, based on the alternating offer strategic model
we propose a network of bargaining agents who mutually either co-
operate or compete, where the feedback mechanism between trad-
ing and price dynamics is driven by an external “hidden” variable
R that quantifies the degree of market overpricing. Due to the feed-
back mechanism, R fluctuates and oscillates over time, and thus
periods when the market is underpriced and overpriced occur re-
peatedly. As the market becomes overpriced, bubbles are created
that ultimately burst as the market reaches a crash tipping point
Rc . The market starts recovering from the crash as a recovery tip-
ping point Rr is reached. The probability that the index will drop
in the next year exhibits a strong hysteresis behavior very much
alike critical transitions in other complex systems. The probability
distribution function of R has a bimodal shape characteristic of
small systems near the tipping point. By examining the S&P500
index we illustrate the applicability of the model and demonstrate
that the financial data exhibit tipping points that agree with the
model. We report a cointegration between the returns of the S&P
500 index and its intrinsic value.

Abstract—Financial markets typically undergo periods of pros-
perity followed by periods of stagnation, and this undulation makes
it challenging to maintain market efficiency. The efficient market
hypothesis (EMH) states that there exist differences in structural
complexity in security prices between regular and abnormal sit-
uations. Yet, despite a clear link between market acceleration (cf.
recession in security prices) and stress in physical systems, indices
of financial stress still have significant scope for further develop-
ment. The overarching aim of this work is therefore to determine
the characteristics of financial indices related to financial stress,
and to establish a robust metric for the extent of such ‘stress’. This
is achieved based on intrinsic multiscale analysis which quanti-
fies the so called complexity-loss hypothesis in the context of fi-
nancial stress. The multiscale sample entropy and our proposed
Assessment of Latent Index of Stress methods have successfully
assessed financial stress, and have served as a measure to establish
an analogy between transitions from ‘normal’ (relaxed) to ‘abnor-
mal’ (stressed) financial periods with the sympatho-vagal balance
in humans. Four major stock indices of the US economy over the
past 25 years are considered: (i) Dow Jones Industrial Average, (ii)
NASDAQ Composite, (iii) Standard & Poor’s 500, and (iv) Rus-
sell 2000, together with FTSE 100, CAC 40 and exchange rates.
Our findings support the EMH theory and reveal high stress for
both the periods of Internet bubble burst and sub-prime mortgage
crisis.

Abstract—Fuzzy systems consisting of networked rule bases,
called fuzzy networks, capture various types of imprecision inher-
ent in financial data and in the decision-making processes on them.
This paper introduces a novel extension of the technique for order-
ing of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method
and uses fuzzy networks to solve multicriteria decision-making
problems where both benefit and cost criteria are presented as
subsystems. Thus, the decision maker evaluates the performance
of each alternative for portfolio optimization and further observes
the performance for both benefit and cost criteria. This approach
improves significantly the transparency of the TOPSIS methods,
while ensuring high effectiveness in comparison with established
approaches. The proposed method is further tested to solve the
problem of selection/ranking of traded equity covering developed
and emergent financial markets. The ranking produced by the
method is validated using Spearman rho rank correlation. Based
on the case study, the proposed method outperforms the existing
TOPSIS approaches in terms of ranking performance.
